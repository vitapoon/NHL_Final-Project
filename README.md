# NHL_Final-Project
Based on my final data, I do  see some correlation between shots type, home advantage, key featuresas and win. 

## Shot Type Analysis
'Wrist Shot','Snap Shot', 'Slap Shot' are the top three shot type in the game, however, Shot Accuracy by type are "Deflected", "Tip-In"and "Backhand"

## Home Advantage
I want to see if there is any home game advantage or away game advantage in Hocky games? It does has a little bit home advantage.

## Important Features with Win
Apart from the shot type and home advantage,there are other important features('goals','shots','hits','pim','faceOffWinPercentage','takeaways','giveaways','powerPlayGoals','powerPlayOpportunities') are correlated to win.

# Machine Learing with different Models

As a result, I ran different machine learning models, the most accuracy I was able to achieve with is the Logistic Regression.
