Based on my final data, I do  see some correlation between shots type, home advantage, key featuresas and win. 

## Shot Type Analysis
'Wrist Shot','Snap Shot', 'Slap Shot' are the top three shot type in the game, however, Shot Accuracy by type are "Deflected", "Tip-In"and "Backhand"

## Home Advantage
I want to see if there is any home game advantage or away game advantage in Hocky games? It does has a little bit home advantage.




As a result, we ran multiple machine learning models, but the most accuracy we were able to achieve with the Easy Ensemble. We received 60% accuracy level and given the data we have, this was a the best so far.
